## Why do I need to join patreon for it?
We provide you with qualitatively high quality plugins, we write these in our spare time. The addons are therefore intended for our supporters. The monthly contribution is less than the average cost of a coffee.
:::info
These addons are not required for the minigame and will never be a prerequisite. They only extend the plugin with a few development-intensive extensions.
