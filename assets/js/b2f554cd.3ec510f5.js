Our plugins supports 1.8.8+ and java8!\\n\\nWe strongly recommend to update your minecraft and java versions shortly as we are (like the spigot community) dropping support requests for 1.18 and lower versions. They will still remain but may not work in the future! May you would need a spigot fork to be compatible with a more recent version of java!\\n\\nIt won\'t take long and java 17 will be a requirement!\\n:::\\n\\n:::danger Plugin Updating - New arena configuration needed\\nOn updating your plugins with the new core update you should make sure to take a **backup**!

The name change from Plajers Lair to Plugily Projects took a little longer in some areas and took some time to get used to. In the end, we went through with the name change completely. Plugily Projects defines us on a broad scale and does not limit us to a one-man operation, as it seemed before.\\nMainly the Wiki, Api service(s) and Discord were affected. We are looking forward to the new time together and have already spent some nice months together under the new name.\\n\\n**Summerbreak 2021**\\n\\nAs you have already seen above, we are in the summer break at the moment. That doesn\'t mean we are inactive, but we are taking some time off and want to relax and spend more time than usual with friends and family. This is the most important wish in our team, to have a hobby that is fun and does not bring any pressure or stress with it. A project that is fun together and educates everyone.\\n\\n**End of (old) beta testers**\\n\\nWe want to thank again all our beta testers that were included into all betas until now. Beta testers please read the last announcement on the beta channel of our discord or read the planned new beta programm to get in touch with the next steps as beta tester ;)\\n\\n**Planned**\\n:::note In short\\nCurrently we want to enhance the experience with our plugins by adding new stuff to them. Here and there along the lines (discord) you will see whats planned or will get changed. Therefore we want to change how we code and how the team works together.
